# Foundation Project: Landing Page

**Live demo Link:** https://volrit.github.io/landing-page/

**What was the object of project:** The goal of this project was to recreate a single-page website using HTML and CSS. The design was provided, and my task was to reproduce it as closely as possible. This website was created solely for the purpose of learning the basics of programming.

**Technologies and tools used:** This website has been built using HTML and CSS. Tools used to maintain, make and publish this website are Command line (Linux Terminal), Visual Studio Code (Code Editor), Git (Version Control), Github(Remote Repository) and GitHub's feature that allows to publish website from public repositories.

**What i learned:** I definitely learned a lot, especially in CSS. For example, the `flex-shrink` property gave me a hard time. Positioning elements is still quite difficult for me, but I believe it will get easier with more practice. I want to continue my learning journey and keep improving my programming skills.
